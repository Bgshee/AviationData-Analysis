# AviationData-Analysis
Overview The project herein identifies the lowest-risk aircraft for the company's expansion into aviation. Recommendations are done based on analysis of historical data regarding aviation accidents, highlighting aircraft models that had lower accident and fatality rates to help the company arrive at decisions for commercial and private enterprise operations.

Project Objectives Objective: To identify aircraft with the lowest operational risk based on historical accident data. Business Need: The company is diversifying its portfolio to include aviation and needs to understand which aircraft models are safest to purchase. Data Source: Aviation Accident Dataset by Kaggle. Key Features: Make (Aircraft Manufacturer) Model aircraft model Injury.Severity (Severity of the accident) Total.Fatal.Injuries Number of fatalities in the accident Purpose.of.flight - Commercial or Private use. Aircraft.damage Degree of aircraft damage Weather.Conditions (Ambient conditions) Broad.Phase.of.Flight (Flight phase during accident) Tools Utilized Python for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data. Tableau: Software used for creating charts and dashboards used in the final presentation. The link to the Dashboard is https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/grace.mwega/viz/AVIATIONSAFETYINSIGHTS/AVIATIONSAFETYINSIGHTS

Jupyter Notebook: To perform exploratory data analysis. Analysis Methodology Clean the data: handle missing values and standardize categorical data. Descriptive Statistics: The synopsis of accident rates, severity, and fatalities by aircraft type and manufacturer. Data Visualization: Graphics and visual summary displays are appropriate to enhance recommendations. Key Takeaways

Some types of aircraft have lower accident rates and fatalities, hence suitable for purchase.
Manufacturers with fewer fatal accidents are recommended for further exploration and negotiations.
Invest in aircraft that have a low accident rate: Prefer types of aircraft with higher safety records.
Choose Reliable Manufacturers: Opt for models made by firms with fewer high-severity collisions.
Operational Costs: Analyze operational and maintenance costs to complement the safety analysis. Additional: More specific information about the experience of the flight crew, the maintenance history, and the routes flown would be enlightening.
